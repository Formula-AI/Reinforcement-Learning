# Reinforcement Learning

This following repository is made for solutions to any problem related to Reinforcement Learning.

The problems can be of any sort and can use any kind of architecture/algorithm, the contributor needs to exlain or provide a link that has an explanation for the procedure.

General Guidelines for contributing:
- Contributors can choose any language and library of their choice.
- For Python Specific contribution both .py as well as .ipnyb files are acceptable.
- The contributors should make sure that the file structure

      └── Reinforcement Learning
          └── Folder with Problem Name
              ├── solution file/files  # solution code to be submitted along with driver file
              ├── data resources       # points to the data used
              ├── .gitignore           # not necessary but try to add one if you have overlapping dependecies
              └── README.md            # Should include the problem statement, libraries and procedure along with any kind of media for better innundation.
              
- Contributors are requested to host any images outside on platforms like imgur and link them to their respective places instead of adding them to the repositories.
- There is no limit to the number of solutions as long as they are different.
- If possible creating an issue before contribution would streamline the process but it is not completely necessary.
- Contributors should treat each other with respect and the contributions shouldn't include anything that violates Github Policies.
- Any kind of private code structure or dataset is not allowed.
- Incase of implementation/recreating Research work, contributors are adviced to add references along with original work.

Using any stolen piece of code is strictly prohibited and necessary steps will be taken if anything is found to be such. Hate comments, intolerance of any kind, and profiling will not be tolerated.
